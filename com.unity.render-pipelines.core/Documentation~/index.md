# Scriptable Render Pipeline Core
![](https://blogs.unity3d.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/image5_rs.png)

A Scriptable Render Pipeline (SRP) allows you to write C# scripts to control the way Unity renders each frame.

Unity provides two prebuilt SRPs: the [Universal Render Pipeline (URP)](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.universal@latest), and the [High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP)](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.high-definition@latest).

SRP Core is a collection of APIs that exposes rendering logic and configuration options for SRPs. You can use the SRP Core package to create your own custom SRP from scratch, to modify one of Unity's prebuilt SRPs, or to understand the technology that underpins Unity's prebuilt SRPs.
